## Introduction

Starting November 3, DALL-E 2 API previously only accessible through their web interfaces. is now available in public beta. This means developers can now use the neural network in their own applications to create images from natural text. This post will cover the steps to create a full-stack application that can interface with the API and generate some cool images in our own web interface using the latest NextJS stack.

## What is DALL-E 2?

DALL-E 2 is a neural network trained on a massive data set of pairs of text and images scraped from the internet that is now competent enough to generate brand-new images from natural language/text. The model is capable of combining unrelated and abstract concepts to render any style of image. Here are some images generated by DALL-E 2 that gives a good idea of what the model is able to do.

The model uses a process called "Diffusion" that draws a completely new picture starting from dots and incrementally changing the patterns until it resembles an image that is recognizable.

## A bit About Next.js

Before we start, let's cover the latest iteration of Next.js from Vercel which lets you create a full-stack application with ease with features including server side rendering, client side rendering, out-of-the-box typescript support, all without much or any configuration. Other benefits include folder path based routing and seamless integration with vercel which lets you deploy directly from you Github account in a matter of seconds. The latest iteration (v13) adds supports fro React server components, ability to stream UI components incrementally, and turbopack, a Rust-based Webpack alternative . We'll be utilising some of the new features in this application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

First, we'll need to have at least Node.js 14 installed on our systems ([https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download "https://nodejs.org/en/download")). Next, create a directory for your project and in this command in the terminal to initialise a node project.

    npm init -y

Next, we'll need to install the project dependencies.

    npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest openai

Add an `app` folder in the root directory and create a `page.js` file with the following contents.

    export default function(){
    	return <div>Hello world!</div>
    }

We'll modify the contents later on.

Next, create a next.config.js folder with the following configuration.

    module.exports =
        { experimental: { appDir: true } }

This will allow us to play with the latest Next 13 features, including the app folder layout.

Finally to run the application add a dev, build and start script inside the `package.json` file, which should look like this:

     "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start"
      },

The final folder structure should look something like this (don't worry about the `layout.js` , as Next.js is smart enough to create one for you).

Now, to run the project simply type the command `npm run dev` which should start a local dev server at `localhost:3000` which should show you the web application. Another benefit of Next.js is that it supports Hot Module replacement out of the box enabling you the develop without having to refresh the app.
