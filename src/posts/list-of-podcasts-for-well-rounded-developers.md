This is a list of podcasts that I listen to every day, sorted by genre:

### Software Engineering:

* [https://softskills.audio/](https://softskills.audio/ "https://softskills.audio/"): Softkills Engineering is a great listen, featuring experienced engineers and witty duo, Dave Smith and Jamison Dance, with their patented `Quit your job` advice. They talk about the non-technical side of software engineering including, but not limited to topics like negotiating pay raises, getting promoted and general workplace etiquette.
* [Command Line Heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes "Command line heroes"): Command line heroes is a podcast that really captures your imagination with stories ranging from futuristic robots, to the history of the world wide web, CLH brings mainstream media like entertainment to tech nerds. Produced by Red Hat and hosted by the founder of CodeNewbie Saron Yitbarek, this podcast never fails to entertain.
