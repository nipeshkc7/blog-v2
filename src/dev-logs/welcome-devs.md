Greetings. I am Arpan, a full-stack software engineer and open source enthusiast based in Sydney currently working at A2B Australia. I started this blog as a way to share my knowledge about topics related to tech and software engineering in general. The upcoming blog posts will focus on a variety of topics including (but not limited to):

* Backend Technologies ( Node.js, Rust) 
* Front-end technologies (React, Vue, Next.js)
* Cloud Technologies (GCP, AWS, Azure)
* DevOps

## What to expect?

I will be documenting my adventures in development including tech like:

* Javascript (React/ Vue/ Node.js)
* Cloud (AWS/GCP)
* And everything Else !
