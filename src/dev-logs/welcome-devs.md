Greetings. I am Arpan, a full-stack software engineer and open source enthusiast based in Sydney currently working at A2B Australia. I started this blog as a way to share my knowledge about topics related to tech and software engineering in general. The upcoming blog posts will focus on a variety of topics including (but not limited to):

* Backend Technologies ( Node.js, Rust) 
* Front-end technologies (React, Vue, Next.js)
* Cloud Technologies (GCP, AWS, Azure)
* DevOps

### About my work

In my day-to-day, I build full-stack solutions and work with different kinds of technologies like Node.js, Azure Cloud Services, React. I like to be involved in products end-to-end, whether the work involves coding, designing API specs based on the Australian government standards, setting up efficient DevOps processes to make my teammates lives easier, setting up a messaging queue for async communication, or just plain making powerBI reports for better business insights.
