When starting a new project, be realistic of the team capabilities and what is achievable in the given timeframe.

### Project Estimation tips

* When planning, create user epics, and build subtasks based on those.
* Pick technology stack to fit not only the requirement but also to fit the timeline
* Sometimes, the simpler the better
* If it does not need to scale, does not make it scalable
* Don't overengineer, and try to focus on the deliverables.
