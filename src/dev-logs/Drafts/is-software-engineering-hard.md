**TLDR; No**

The long answer is a bit more complicated.

Software Engineering is the field everyone wants to get into these days. Depending on the place you work at, it can offer benefits such as good pay, flexible working hours, remote working options, and in 2022, even 4-day weeks aren't unheard of. And with the workforce going global, in my opinion, this is the most exciting time to be in tech. But the question in many people's minds is, how hard is it to get into a software engineering role? Before answering that we need to know how does one become a software engineer.
