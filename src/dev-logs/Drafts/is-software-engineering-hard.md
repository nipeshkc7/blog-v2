**TLDR; No**

The long answer is a bit more complicated.

Software Engineering is the field everyone wants to get into these days. Depending on the place you work at, it can offer benefits such as good pay, flexible working hours, remote working options, and in 2022, even 4-day work-weeks aren't unheard of. And with the workforce going global, in my opinion, this is the most exciting time to be in tech. But the question in many people's minds is, how hard is it to get into a software engineering role? Before answering that we need to know how does one becomes a software engineer.

## How does one become a software engineer?

The most common path for engineers has been to get a Computer Science degree from an institution of their choosing, where they learn about topics with the major ones including Data Structures and Algorithm, a programming language with basic concepts sprinkled in, problem-solving. And depending on the type of institution you're involved in, you will have ample opportunities to gain industry experience as many companies are very keen to reach out and hire interns directly from universities. A less traditional route, but seen more common post-2017,  would be to go through a Bootcamp that mostly focuses on teaching an industry favorite languages and web technologies like React to help students land a job. And believe it or not, many people quit

## When it's hard?

When you're not curious and love building stuff.

## When it's easy?

When you don't love problem-solving.

## Not for you if?

You don't enjoy digging into a problem and spending hours trying to solve it.
